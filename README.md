I hardly finish up with 70% of the books i read (I don't think anyone should). So it's quite hard for me to decide if:

Books read = [books completed] or [Books completed + not completed].Â 

This post will be divided into three parts:

- Favorite books in 2020;
- Books finished in 2020; and
- Still Reading (and i have 2/3 books i enjoyed so much that i intentionally decided not to finish it).
